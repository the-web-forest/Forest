  <p align="center">A collection of microservices that supports the Web Forest ecosystem.</p>
  
## Philosophy ðŸŒ³
Web Forest is a NGO, our goal is straightforward: We want to improve the world using technology and ecology.
To achieve our objective we develop a gamified platform that allows the users to plant trees in real-world 100% online using their credit card. Got confused? I will explain! 
When our project V1 gets ready you will be able to create an account in Web Forest platform and create your own custom virtual forest with your name or nickname.
You will get access to a lot of virtual trees and you will buy them and plant them with less than 5 clicks. With the purpose of your tree being unique, you will be able to customize your tree by giving a name and a description.
And how the virtual trees will be transformed into real trees? This is easy! By the end of every month, we will repass the raised money to others NGOs that plant real trees. This process will convert virtual trees into real trees.

## Description ðŸŒ²
**Forest** is a collection of .NET microservices that allows Web Forest to operate. Currently, we have those microservices described below and you can see their code on this Github repository. 

Our microservices are baptized with plant/trees names in Brazillian Portuguese, so we have: 

- **IpÃª *(Tabebuia)*** - Is an exposed microservice that communicates with our main platform and allows our users to manage your account and your custom forest. 
- **Bonsai (Bonsai Tree)** - Is an internal microservice that is our payment engine. There are no public endpoints and this microservice serves other microservices. Every donation to Web Forest ecosystem passes through Bonsai.
- **Samauma (Ceiba Pentandra)** - Is an internal microservice for our backoffice. There are no public endpoints.
